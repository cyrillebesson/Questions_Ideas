## Weird Adding Suit ?
I noticed that if you take a long number like 12345 and you separate it in multiple pieces that you add together and keep going, you'll always end up with the same number.

example :
<br>
12345
<br>
123 + 45 = 168 -> 16 + 8 = 24 -> 2 + 4 = 6
<br>
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 -> 1 + 5 = 6
<br>
12 + 34 + 5 = 51 -> 5 + 1 = 6

Does it have a name ?
<br>
Is it usefull ?
